            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,363 texts created during Phase 1 of the project have been released into the public domain as of 1 January 2015. Anyone can now take and use these texts for their own purposes, but we respectfully request that due credit and attribution is given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Full documentation of the original data capture process is available from the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.
   All versions of the texts are now archived and freely available for download. See <ref target="https://textcreationpartnership.org/faq/#faq05">the TCP Download FAQ</ref>
   for detailed information. The TEI P5 versions are also freely available from the <ref target="https://github.com/textcreationpartnership">TCP Github repository</ref>.</p>

            <head>REASONS HUMBLY OFFERED For Excepting the Rivers of <hi>Elbe, Weser,</hi> and <hi>Eyder,</hi> out of the BILL for a General Liberty of Exporting the <hi>Woollen Manufactures</hi> of this KINGDOM.</head>
            <p>THE most ancient Company of <hi>Merchant-Adventures</hi> of <hi>England</hi> having published several times in the <hi>Gazette,</hi> That all their Majesties Subjects (Handycrafts Men only excepted) may come into the said Company for 40 <hi>s.</hi> Fine, and thereby be equally intituled with all other Members of the said Company to have the Benefit of all the honorable and ad<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vantageous Privileges the said Company enjoyeth in the City of <hi>Hamburgh</hi> and elsewhere, whereby they have made the said Company so extensive, as that they cannot but hope it will give a general Satisfaction.</p>
            <p>And having likewise, as they humbly conceive, cleared all Objections and Aspersions against their Admission, Oath, and their By-Laws, that they are no way ensnaring nor destructive to Trade, but alterable at Will and Pleasure, as they conceive it may be most conducing to the Improvement and Increase of the Exportation of the Woollen Manufacture of <hi>England</hi> into the Limits of their Charter, into all which Limits they have granted or consented, That all Persons whatsoever may freely Export the Woollen Manufacture of this Kingdom (excepting to the Rivers of <hi>Elbe, Weser,</hi> and <hi>Eyder</hi>) which is in substance no more than to preserve their Trade to the City of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> and the great Privileges they enjoy there, whereof all Persons that come into the said Company may have the like Benefit, that being their staple Town, where they always keep great Quantities of <hi>English</hi> Woollen Manufactures, for Furnishing those Parts at all times plentifully with what they have occasion for.</p>
            <p>And having also, as they conceive, sufficiently set forth, that the Increase of the Exportation of the Woollen Manufacture in the Years 1690, 1691, and 1692, was not to be attributed unto the Freedom then granted, but unto other Accidents then and in the former three Years attending Trade. And it appearing, that in this last Year 1693 there hath been a more liberal Exportation of the Woollen Manufacture of this Kingdom, than in either of the three Years of Freedom, they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceive and hope than it will be granted, the said Company have not hindered the Exportation of the Woollen Manufacture, but advanced the same, and consequently the Price of Wool.</p>
            <p>And it having been fully demonstrated, by what indirect Means the Foreigners undermine and seek to root out the <hi>English</hi> Merchants, and for a present Profit to themselves debase the Woollen Manu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>facture of this Nation, to the great Discredit and Prejudice thereof in Foreign Parts, and what Pro<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>vision there is made in <hi>Germany</hi> to secure the Trade of those Parts unto their Natives, to the Ex<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clusion of Foreigners; it is evidently plain, That no <hi>English</hi> Men can carry on any Trade in <hi>Germany</hi> for their own Accounts, unless the said Company and their Privileges be preserved in the City of <hi>Hamburgh.</hi> And if the <hi>English</hi> Merchant becomes extinct abroad, the <hi>English</hi> Factor will soon be extinct at home, for the Foreigners employ no <hi>English</hi> Men longer than until they can introduce their own Relations and Country Men. And if the <hi>English</hi> Merchant be not supported, the <hi>English</hi> Navigation must needs cease; for it is very known, that Foreigners do at all times employ their own Shipping, and never any <hi>English,</hi> but in case of Necessity.</p>
            <p>And as to the West-Country Commodities, and the Exportation and Consumption thereof into the Parts of <hi>Germany;</hi> the said Company intend, and hope to make it appear, that they will be so far from lessening and preventing the same, as that they will, to the utmost of their power, promote its Encrease by its Exportation into <hi>Germany.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>And as to all other frivolous Objections and Aspersions against the said Company, wherein there is as little Foundation of Reason as of Truth, they have already been so fully answered, that there needs no farther Reply to be given to them.</p>
            <p>But by what is now, and heretofore hath been set forth, it is humbly hoped, that the Honorable <hi>House of Commons,</hi> and every Member of the same, will have received so full Satisfaction, so as that the said Ancient Company of <hi>Merchant-Adventurers</hi> of <hi>England</hi> may be received into their Favour, so far as it concerneth their Trade for the City of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> by Excepting the Rivers of <hi>Elbe, Weser,</hi> and <hi>Eyder,</hi> out of the Bill for the Free Liberty of Exporting the Woollen Manufacture of <hi>England</hi> into the Limits of the said Company's Charter; that the great and honorable Privileges the said Company enjoy in the City of <hi>Hamburgh,</hi> whereof all Their Majesties Subjects coming into the said Company may enjoy the Benefit, be not totally lost, and the <hi>English</hi> Merchants to those Parts become extinct, the <hi>English</hi> Navigation thither lost, and the Trade of the Woollen Manufacture wholly devolve into the Hands of Foreigners, whereby they will have an Opportunity to regulate and ruin the same to their own Advantage: But that they will be pleased to make an Experiment in what Manner, and how the said Company can manage the Trade of the Woollen Manufacture to the Encrease and Advantage of the same, and Honour of the Nation, as their Predecessors hereto<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fore unquestionably did.</p>
